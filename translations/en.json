Among her siblings, she is by far the least intelligent (or so she has always convinced herself), due to her poor academic prowess in high school. But, she quickly realized her abilities when she determined to achieve her goals. In fact, she is persevering and has always been described as a strong woman. She ended up passing all her classes to the point of becoming the first (men and women combined) to hold a PhD degree in her entire extended family.",

After being selected for a doctorate, her thesis topic, which dealt with the clean-up of hydrocarbon-polluted soils, was funded by the Schlumberber Foundation (Faculty For The Future). This grant is awarded to women from developing countries enrolled in doctoral or post-doctoral studies. Dr. Matsodoum pursued her thesis work in partnership with the University of Yaoundé I in Cameroon and the University of Strasbourg in France and defended her doctoral thesis in Biotechnologies and Environment on May 20, 2019. This day is a celebration day in her country and will remain memorable for her, especially as it marks Cameroon's independence.",
